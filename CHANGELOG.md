# Changelog

## v2.2.3 - 2026-05-27

### Features

- **Usage reset radar.** New `/subscriptions` page consolidates the Codex Reset Radar summary, recent RSS events, and a reset-time hook. When a window-close signal is detected the backend clears stale cooldown/usage caches and re-tests every account so the pool reflects the new reset boundary immediately.
- **Streaming batch operations in admin.** Account batch refresh/test/enable/disable/lock/reset now stream per-account progress events (`success/banned/rate_limited/failed`) to the admin UI instead of waiting for the full operation to complete.
- **Compact usage number setting.** Added a system setting to render token counts with K/M units in the usage table for easier reading at scale.
- **Card view for account management.** Desktop accounts page gains a table/card view toggle (up to 5 cards per row on `xl` screens). Choice is persisted in `localStorage`.
- **Status badge error tooltip.** Hovering an `unauthorized` or `error` status badge now surfaces the full upstream error message in a popover, matching the usage log status code tooltip style.
- **Anthropic `speed: fast` forwarding (#170).** Anthropic-style `speed: fast` requests now map to the Codex priority tier upstream so fast clients get fast tokens end-to-end.

### Fixes

- **Version popover always clickable.** The sidebar version badge now opens the popover even when the GitHub latest-version lookup is still pending or blocked; a "checking…" hint is shown until the remote tag arrives.
- **First-token timeout and scheduler races.** Hardened the proxy path so first-token timeouts and concurrent scheduler races no longer collapse into a spurious "no available account" 503.
- **`/responses` WebSocket ingress.** WebSocket clients hitting `ws://host/v1/responses` are now accepted; the prior 404/101 misclassification has been fixed. Setting `CODEX_UPSTREAM_TRANSPORT=ws` no longer reports the connect handshake as an unknown error.
- **Anthropic content preservation + deactivated probe flagging.** Anthropic-shaped responses keep their original content blocks; deactivated accounts are clearly flagged in probe state instead of silently appearing healthy.
- **Wham window classification.** Usage window classification now uses `limit_window_seconds` rather than field position, so free-tier accounts no longer have a 7d window misclassified as 5h.

## v2.2.2 - 2026-05-26

### Features

- **First-run setup and admin auth polish.** Added setup guidance for unconfigured deployments, improved the admin authentication flow, and added a frontend logout path.
- **Runtime status API and page.** Added machine-readable runtime checks for service, database, cache, usage log writer, probes, account pool, image storage, and admin auth.
- **Background media customization.** Added configurable background image/video support, realtime glass opacity/blur controls, and raised MP4 dynamic wallpaper uploads to 40MB while keeping image uploads capped at 20MB.
- **Quick-start configuration options.** Added fast-mode and reasoning-effort snippets for supported client templates in the usage docs.
- **Issue templates.** Added structured Chinese and English GitHub issue templates for bugs, ideas, UI feedback, deployment help, and questions.

### Fixes

- **Request body sizing for wallpapers.** Raised the default request body limit to 48MB so 40MB MP4 background uploads can pass multipart overhead safely.

# Changelog — iteration/may-2026-v2

Dates: 2026-05-13 to 2026-05-20. 17 commits.

## Features

- **Credit quota support (#141).** Added `credit_enabled` and `credit_skip_usage_window` flags to the accounts table. Credit-marked accounts skip usage-window penalties in the scheduler. Managed via `PATCH /api/admin/accounts/:id/credit`.

- **Scheduler mode (#133).** Added `scheduler_mode` system setting with two modes: `round_robin` (default, weighted by dispatch score) and `remaining_quota` (prioritize accounts with lowest usage percent). Configurable from Admin Settings page.

- **5h/7d windowed USD cost display.** Replaced the single total-cost column with a windowed billing view. Each account now shows `billed_5h` and `billed_7d` fields aligned with the account's usage-reset boundaries. This reflects actual spending, not estimated token costs.

- **Image-to-image in Image Studio (#135, #136).** The admin Image Studio now supports image-to-image generation via `POST /api/admin/images/edit-jobs`, accepting reference image URLs or data URIs. Added text-to-image and image-to-image tabs in the frontend.

- **Billing model expansion.** Added pricing for gpt-5.5-pro and gpt-5.4-pro families. Implemented long context (>272K tokens) premium pricing for gpt-5.5, gpt-5.5-pro, gpt-5.4, gpt-5.4-pro with automatic detection. Fixed gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini cache-read pricing.

## Fixes

- **GPT-5.5 pricing corrected.** Updated standard-tier billing from old values to $5.00/M input / $30.00/M output (priority: $12.50/M / $75.00/M), matching current official pricing.

- **SSE stream isolation.** Prevented SSE response mixing when retrying across accounts, using `c.Writer.Written()` as the retry guard instead of a package-level flag.

- **Usage logging for image errors.** Added usage-log emits for read-error paths in image generation, ensuring billing records are not silently dropped on stream failures.

- **Model mapping initialization.** Restored `modelMapping` init that was accidentally removed during the scheduler_mode refactor.

- **Credit field Scan order.** Fixed PostgreSQL `Scan` argument ordering for credit fields that was causing silent zero-values.

- **Round 2 review fixes.** Addressed Haiku review findings including api.ts syntax cleanup, billing test corrections, and several CRITICAL/HIGH issues from automated review.

## Security

- **SQLite default binds to localhost.** SQLite compose files (`docker-compose.sqlite.yml`, `docker-compose.sqlite.local.yml`) now bind ports to `127.0.0.1` by default. Previously they bound to `0.0.0.0`, exposing the service on all interfaces. Standard (PostgreSQL) compose files retain the `0.0.0.0` default.

- **BIND_HOST env var.** Added `BIND_HOST` environment variable support to control the HTTP listen address across all deployment modes. Documented in `.env.example`, `.env.sqlite.example`, and `CONFIGURATION.md`.

## Breaking Changes

- **SQLite compose port binding.** SQLite deployments upgrading from a previous version that relied on external access via the default compose configuration must now explicitly set `BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` in `.env` or override the port binding in the compose file. All other behavior remains backwards-compatible.
